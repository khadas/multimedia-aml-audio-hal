     *                     (e.g. AUDIO_STREAM_MUSIC).
     * sampleRate:         Data source sampling rate in Hz.  Zero means to use the sink sample rate.
     *                     A non-zero value must be specified if AUDIO_OUTPUT_FLAG_DIRECT is set.
     *                     0 will not work with current policy implementation for direct output
     *                     selection where an exact match is needed for sampling rate.
     * format:             Audio format. For mixed tracks, any PCM format supported by server is OK.
     *                     For direct and offloaded tracks, the possible format(s) depends on the
     *                     output sink.
     * channelMask:        Channel mask, such that audio_is_output_channel(channelMask) is true.
     * flags:              See comments on audio_output_flags_t in <system/audio.h>.
